Hereâ€™s an updated version of the README file for your GitHub repository, designed to provide a clear and professional overview of the Greddiit project:

Greddiit
Greddiit is a Dockerized web portal inspired by Reddit, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It offers a social media platform where users can register, create and manage posts, and moderate communities (Sub Greddiits). Docker and Nginx ensure the application is easily deployable and scalable.

Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with hashed passwords and token-based authentication.
Post and Comment System: Users can create, view, upvote, and manage posts with multi-level commenting.
